# Muzyk - A Spotify clone

ðŸ‘‹ Check out this fully working Spotify clone! This demo is made using TypeScript, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I built this to simply explore different APIs (Spotify, in this case) and practice my TypeScript. I chose Spotify as I am a music lover and in my opinion, Spotify's UI is one of the best out there!ðŸ”¥
