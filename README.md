# Muzyk - A Spotify clone

ðŸ‘‹ Check out this fully working Spotify clone! This demo is made using TypeScript, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I built this to simply explore different APIs (Spotify, in this case) and practice my TypeScript. I chose Spotify as I am a music lover and in my opinion, Spotify's UI is one of the best out there!ðŸ”¥

## All Technologies used

1. [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
2. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
3. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
4. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
5. [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)

## To run it locally

1. Clone this repo on your machine and run `npm i`
2. Then run `npm run dev` which will bring the demo to life on `http://localhost:3000/`
3. It should automatically redirect you to Spotify custom login page, if it does not, go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
4. Login using your Spotify credentials and your playlists will be loaded.
5. To use the music controls, first open the spotify app on any of your device and play the song so that the API is able to communicate with the demo.
6. All done! You can now use the demo just like Spotify.
